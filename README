1. Configuration Instructions
	
	This project makes use of several devices which are listed below:	
	_ 1 Raspberry Pi 3 device.
	_ 1 Straight-through RJ45 cable for Raspberry Pi 3 to access the internet.
	_ 1 16GB SD Card element 14 pre-installed with NOOBS for Raspberry Pi.
	_ 1 USB cable (type A to type B) to power the Raspberry Pi device.
	_ 1 sound card for recording sound.
	_ 1 micro phone for recording sound.
	_ Internet access and the server.

1.1 Configure USB sound card as default audio device
	
	1.	Boot up RPi, and apply the USB sound card. Use .lsusb. command to check if your USB sound card is mounted:
	2.	Use "sudo nano /etc/asound.conf" command and put following content to the file:

	pcm.!default {
		type plug
		slave {
			pcm "hw:1,0"
		}
	}
	ctl.!default {
		type hw
		card 1
	}

1.2 Install Libcurl library

	1.	First use command "ls /usr/include/curl" or "ls /usr/include/arm-linux-gnueabihf/curl" 
        to identify that libcurl library is installed.

	2.	If the folder doesn.t exist. Run .sudo apt-get update. to update the application list.

	3.	Run .sudo apt-get install libcurl3. to install the libcurl3.

	4.	Run .sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev. to install the development API of libcurl4.

2. Installation Instructions

	_ Insert the SD card into the Raspberry device, and also plug the RJ45 cable in to access the internet.
	
	_ Power on the device by using the USB cable.
	
	_ Initialize the Raspberry device, change its default setting for sound card and network.
	
	_ Check the email for IP address.
	
	_ Use Putty application to remotely interact with Raspberry device.
	
	_ Plug in the sound card along with the microphone.

3. Operating Instructing

	_ Open the Putty terminal, enter the IP address received in the email and then click "Open".
	
	_ Log in to the device using the name "pi" and accompanying password.
	
	_ Go to the "appdev" folder by utilizing the command "cd" and 
	  then check the presence of all the files by the command "ls".
	
	_ Type in the command "make" to start the compilation process.
	
	_ Run the command "./sound.a" to start executing the resulting file.
	
	_ Using the microphone, start recording the sequence of 1-second WAV files. 
	  For each file, the program will calculate the rms value 
	  for every 200 samples of data, for a total of 80 values.	
	
	_ For each 10 rms values, one rms value of all of them will be calculated, 
	  and finally these 8 pieces of data will be sent to the server for convenient display.

4. File list (Manifest)

	_ main.c
	  This is the root file.
	
	_ sound.c
	  This file contains code for extracting information from the WAV file and processes it,
	  then display the result.
	
	_ sound.h
	  This is the header file for sound.c
	
	_ screen.c
	  This file contains code for displaying the rms result on the screen.
	
	_ screen.h
	  This is the header file for screen.c
	
	_ comm.c
	  This file contains code for the Raspberry Pi communicating with online server
	
	_ comm.h
	  This is the header file for comm.c
	
	_ makefile
	  This file sets the rule for the compilation of the code and several other actions
	
	_ sound.php
	  This file is stored in the server so as to process the data received from the pi and display to the user
